# Museum
Design Rationale & AI Reflection
The Museum of Wonder site was designed with accessibility, clarity, and clean navigation in mind. A semantic HTML structure was used to support screen readers and SEO, with consistent file paths and descriptive alt text to ensure all media is accessible. CSS follows a simple, responsive grid layout to present content in a visually balanced way, while meaningful filenames and logical folder organization maintain project clarity. Color, typography, and imagery were chosen to evoke a sense of history and discovery without overwhelming the user.

AI tools were used to accelerate content generation, image description, and code scaffolding under direct human supervision. All AI-generated materials were reviewed, edited, and validated for accuracy, accessibility, and alignment with project requirements. This human-in-the-loop process ensured the final work met academic standards while leveraging AI for efficiency.
