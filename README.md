# Museum

## Design Rationale
The Museum of Wonder site was designed with accessibility, clarity, and clean navigation in mind. A semantic HTML structure supports screen readers and SEO, with consistent file paths and descriptive alt text to ensure all media is accessible. CSS follows a simple, responsive grid layout to present content in a visually balanced way, while meaningful filenames and logical folder organization maintain project clarity. Color, typography, and imagery were chosen to evoke a sense of history and discovery without overwhelming the user.
This project follows best practices for:

Accessible navigation (Skip to content links, semantic headings)

SEO readiness (meta tags, descriptive image alt attributes)

Organized file structure (HTML pages in /html, images in /images, CSS in /css)

## AI Reflection
AI tools were used to accelerate content generation, image description, and code scaffolding under direct human supervision. All AI-generated materials were reviewed, edited, and validated for accuracy, accessibility, and alignment with project requirements. This human-in-the-loop process ensured the final work met academic standards while leveraging AI for efficiency.

> **AI Disclosure:** Some content/images in this site were created by AI and edited by a human before publication.
