          <h3>Mask of the Harmattan — Exhibit Label</h3>

          <h4>Facts</h4>
          <p><strong>Material:</strong> Carved iroko wood; fiber fringe; mineral pigment.</p>
          <p><strong>Approx. date:</strong> 17th–19th c. (oral chronologies).</p>
          <p><strong>Region:</strong> Inland Sahel trade corridor.</p>
          <p><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 36 × 22 × 14 cm. <em>On display courtesy of the Diallo family archive.</em></p>

          <h4>Interpretation</h4>
          <p>
            The mask is associated with the season when the dry Harmattan wind arrives, blanching sky and skin alike.
            Its slit eyes and jutting jaw exaggerate scarcity: breath is short, water is counted, words are measured.
            During village processions that mark the first dust-laden gusts, the wearer moves in staccato bursts, stopping
            to “drink” air through the maw while the chorus rattles gourds—an auditory stand-in for sand against a calabash.
            The pigments are not merely decorative: ochre and kaolin are rubbed in with oil at the end of each season,
            sealing prayers for endurance into the wood. While outsiders often read such masks as fixed “spirits,” the
            custodians insist the figure is relational: it becomes a person only when dust, song, dancer, and witness meet.
          </p>

          <h4>Comparative Notes</h4>
          <p>
            Similar dust-season effigies appear from Senegambia to Hausaland. Some emphasize tooth rows; others,
            filament beards that “sweep” paths clear. Compared with coastal masquerades, Harmattan figures tend to
            minimize ornament and maximize silhouette—perhaps because everything extra is lost to the wind.
          </p>

          <h4>Cautionary Note on Interpretation</h4>
          <p>
            Dates and functions are based on overlapping oral accounts gathered a century apart. Without a secure excavation
            context, any single narrative would be misleading; this label preserves plurality where certainty is not possible.

  <!-- 1. Basaltic Glyphstone -->
  <div class="modal-item" id="modal-text-glyphstone" hidden>
    <h2 id="modal-title">Basaltic Glyphstone — Collection Note</h2>
    <p><strong>Material:</strong> Basalt, iron-rich patina.</p>
    <p><strong>Function:</strong> Boundary/rite marker; possible oath stone.</p>
    <p><strong>Location Found:</strong> Inland Niger Delta terrace, near an abandoned causeway.</p>
    <h3>Interpretation</h3>
    <p>
      The shallow incisions on the stone do not form an alphabet; they index presence. A keeper would score the surface
      during oath-making, tracing lines that paired a name with a promise. The stone’s working face slopes to shed rain,
      and the upper edge is smoothed by repeated touch. Microscopic striations suggest reed pens charged with ochre were
      occasionally drawn through the grooves, brightening cuts so they could be “counted” in morning light. Basalt was
      not quarried locally; the boulder was dragged from an older lava field and recentered here, which confers gravity—
      a sense that law is anchored to deep time rather than a single reign. The criss-crossing scars read like a net:
      each pledge catches on another, holding the community together even as generations pass.

  <!-- 2. Riverbank Water Jar -->
  <div class="modal-item" id="modal-text-waterjar" hidden>
    <h2 id="modal-title">Riverbank Water Jar — Collection Note</h2>
    <p><strong>Material:</strong> Low-fired clay with vegetal temper; soot accretions.</p>
    <p><strong>Function:</strong> Storage and cooling of potable water.</p>
    <p><strong>Location Found:</strong> Collapsed riverside shelter, silted to the rim.</p>
    <h3>Interpretation</h3>
    <p>
      This jar bears heat in reverse. Firing was brief and cool, leaving the walls porous so water could breathe out
      and evaporate, drawing away warmth. Soot on the shoulder indicates proximity to a hearth, yet the interior is
      lime-clean, suggesting a customary wash of ash-water to sweeten taste. A thumb-pressed cordon around the neck
      is both decoration and grip; its rhythm matches counting songs used to time chores at dawn. Pots like this are
      rarely signed; the potter’s identity is carried by clay source and coil cadence. Found upright amid flood silt,
      the vessel likely floated as the shelter broke, then settled as the water retreated—a quiet survival that mirrors
      its function: to keep calm, cool life at the center of a hot day.

  <!-- 3. Copper Trade Ring -->
  <div class="modal-item" id="modal-text-ring" hidden>
    <h2 id="modal-title">Copper Trade Ring — Collection Note</h2>
    <p><strong>Material:</strong> Copper alloy with malachite patina.</p>
    <p><strong>Function:</strong> Wearable currency / bridewealth token.</p>
    <p><strong>Location Found:</strong> Market mound, edge of caravan staging ground.</p>
    <h3>Interpretation</h3>
    <p>
      Too large for a finger, too heavy for a toe, this ring lived on the wrist or hung from a trade belt where its
      soft chime announced solvency. Copper carried stories: from ore hills to smelting hearths, from smithy to stall.
      The ring’s flat inner face reduces skin pinch; the outer bevel catches light, a small sun advertising value even
      when dust dulls the surface. Copper’s green is not neglect but memory—minerals returning toward earth. Oral accounts
      pair such rings with negotiations that balanced desire and obligation: what is a fair exchange when futures are
      also being traded? The ring’s worn notch implies it was tied as collateral more than once. Currency, yes; but also
      a promise looped and reopened as lives intertwined.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- 4. Mask of the Harmattan -->
  <div class="modal-item" id="modal-text-mask" hidden>
    <h2 id="modal-title">Mask of the Harmattan — Collection Note</h2>
    <p><strong>Material:</strong> Iroko wood; fiber fringe; mineral pigment.</p>
    <p><strong>Function:</strong> Seasonal masquerade; wind-season rites.</p>
    <p><strong>Location Found:</strong> Custodial house near Sahel caravan node.</p>
    <h3>Interpretation</h3>
    <p>
      The mask “arrives” with the wind, not with a person. Custodians say it sleeps on a shelf until the first dust
      finds it; only then may a dancer carry the face into the square. Slit eyes control air to the wearer, forcing
      short breaths that match the drum’s clipped meter. That constraint is moral: during scarcity, take in little,
      give out song. Pigments were renewed annually with oil that smelled of peanuts and prayer. While museums read
      faces as individuals, the community speaks of weather kin—figures that belong to a family of forces. Its power
      is thus not ownership but right relation: honoring what arrives and always leaves again.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- 5. Leather Talisman Pouch -->
  <div class="modal-item" id="modal-text-pouch" hidden>
    <h2 id="modal-title">Leather Talisman Pouch — Collection Note</h2>
    <p><strong>Material:</strong> Tanned goat leather; sinew; vegetal dye; paper amulet.</p>
    <p><strong>Function:</strong> Personal protection; portable blessing.</p>
    <p><strong>Location Found:</strong> Family trunk with travel gear and prayer beads.</p>
    <h3>Interpretation</h3>
    <p>
      The pouch is a house for small words. Inside, a folded square bears a verse written by an itinerant scholar who
      exchanged ink for millet on his way between river towns. The leather is dyed with acacia pods; the color darkens
      around the flap where fingers worried it before sleep. Triangular points along the seam reference teeth—signs that
      the pouch “bites” misfortune before it can enter a life. Unlike luxury cases, this one shows repairs that honor use:
      a mended stitch in bright thread turns damage into witness. To wear it was to carry conversation: between family,
      teacher, and the One who listens through dust and rain alike.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- 6. Cowrie-Adorned Belt -->
  <div class="modal-item" id="modal-text-belt" hidden>
    <h2 id="modal-title">Cowrie-Adorned Belt — Collection Note</h2>
    <p><strong>Material:</strong> Plaited plant fiber; cowrie shells; indigo thread.</p>
    <p><strong>Function:</strong> Ceremonial dress; status marker; rhythm accent in dance.</p>
    <p><strong>Location Found:</strong> Heirloom chest from a river-port household.</p>
    <h3>Interpretation</h3>
    <p>
      Cowries once priced salt, cloth, and companionship. Sewn to a belt, they announce both wealth and belonging:
      each shell’s mouth clacks softly against its neighbor to keep time with steps. The plait shows a five-over pattern
      common in river towns, and the indigo knots were added later to tighten a stretch—evidence that garments live as
      bodies change. Some cowries are older than the belt itself, drilled on a different axis; they are stories adopted
      into a new home. In performance, light catches the porcelain curves like river sparks at dusk, reminding the crowd
      that all journeys—water, trade, marriage—circle back through the same bright channel.
