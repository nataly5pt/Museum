        <h3>Mask of the Harmattan — Exhibit Label</h3>

        <h4>Facts</h4>
        <p>
          Material: carved iroko wood; fiber fringe; mineral pigment.<br>
          Approx. date: 17th–19th c. (oral chronologies).<br>
          Region: Inland Sahel trade corridor.<br>
          Dimensions: 36 × 22 × 14 cm. On display courtesy of the Diallo family archive.
        </p>

        <h4>Interpretation</h4>
        <p>
          The mask is associated with the season when the dry Harmattan wind arrives, blanching
          sky and skin alike. Its slit eyes and jutting jaw exaggerate scarcity: breath is short,
          water is counted, words are measured. During village processions that mark the first dust-laden
          gusts, the wearer moves in staccato bursts, stopping to “drink” air through the maw while the
          chorus rattles gourds—an auditory stand-in for sand against a calabash. The pigments are not
          merely decorative: ochre and kaolin are rubbed in with oil at the end of each season, sealing
          prayers for endurance into the wood. While outsiders often read such masks as fixed “spirits,”
          the custodians insist the figure is relational: it becomes a person only when dust, song, dancer,
          and witness meet.
        </p>

        <h4>Comparative Notes</h4>
        <p>
          Masks from nearby riverine groups emphasize fish and fertility when the flooding pulses
          northward; this face, by contrast, abstracts the wind. The fiber fringe recalls millet rootlets,
          linking drought and sowing. A similar jawline appears in drought-year headdresses collected by
          French officers in the 1890s; unlike those pieces, this mask retains soot traces from hearth
          storage, suggesting it circulated between shrine and household rather than remaining a chiefly emblem.
        </p>

        <h4>Cautionary Note on Interpretation</h4>
        <p>
          Much prior writing flattened seasonal observances into “secret societies.” Local
          testimony describes more porous practice: women sing lead verses, children pelt the dancer with
          puffed rice, and elders negotiate when to end the route—pragmatic decisions based on wind strength,
          not occult timetable. Our reading privileges these living accounts and accepts disagreement between
          narrators as part of the object’s truth.

  <p>
    The glyphstone carries shallow incisions that form a broken chevron and a bead-line border.
    Unlike votive stones that sit in shrines, this block shows abrasion on two opposing edges, as if
    dragged and re-set multiple times along a route. Ochre dust trapped inside the cuts suggests the
    marks were periodically renewed with pigment so they could be seen at dawn or through Harmattan haze.
    Oral accounts describe “talking stones” that told travelers which saddle to choose when the wind rose.
    This piece likely worked as both instruction and reassurance: a human fingerprint on a hard landscape.
    The chevron points toward a seasonal water notch, aligning with other markers found in 2023 by student
    survey teams. If read together, they form a dotted path that snakes around dunes rather than crossing
    them—evidence of a practical intelligence that favored endurance over speed.

    This mask is danced when the dry wind first whitens the horizon. Its slit eyes narrow the field of
    vision, helping the performer move by drum cues rather than distant landmarks. The jaw—oversized and
    hollow—funnels breath; spectators describe hearing a low vessel-like hum when the dancer exhales through
    it. Pigments are renewed annually with oil and ash from the communal hearth, so protection is literally
    bound up with cooking and care. Children throw puffed rice as “soft stones,” symbolically pelting the
    wind that scours gardens. Contrary to older catalogs that label such pieces “secret,” the rite is
    permeable: women lead the call-and-response, and the route is negotiated each year depending on wind
    strength. The mask therefore acts as a seasonal contract more than a fixed deity—an object that convenes
    neighbors to admit hardship and promise mutual aid until the rains return.
