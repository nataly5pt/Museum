          <h3>Obsidian Spearhead — Exhibit Label</h3>

          <h4>Facts</h4>
          <p><strong>Material:</strong> Volcanic glass (obsidian), pressure-flaked.</p>
          <p><strong>Approx. date:</strong> Late Holocene (relative, stratigraphic).</p>
          <p><strong>Region:</strong> Inland Sahel caravan margin, secondary dune ridge.</p>
          <p><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 11.2 × 3.1 × 0.7 cm. <em>On display courtesy of the Field School Depot.</em></p>

          <h4>Interpretation</h4>
          <p>
            Obsidian cuts because it breaks like lightning: conchoidal, fast, and purposeful. The maker seated the
            blank on a palm and drew sharp pressure along the edge to lift thin flakes, a rhythm of intake and release
            that turned glass into intention. Spearheads like this travel easily through both space and story. Their raw
            material often moves hundreds of kilometers from volcano to camp, bundled in trade as nodules or rough
            preforms. The polish along the hafting end suggests repeated mounting and removal—a kit that shifted between
            hunter, scout, and guardian as a day unfolded. Under magnification, tiny step fractures near the tip imply
            contact with bone or heavy hide. Whether that contact was feast or defense is not knowable here; the point
            is honest about use but discreet about outcome.
          </p>

          <h4>Comparative Notes</h4>
          <p>
            Similar pressure-flaked forms occur across Africa’s Rift and Sahara margins, but the narrow “waisted”
            hafting seen here aligns with riverine groups who preferred slimmer foreshafts that could be repaired quickly.
            Trace-element sourcing may link this glass to an East African flow; if so, the object also maps a conversation
            route—merchants, marriage ties, and seasonal employment—threading savanna and desert.
          </p>

          <h4>Cautionary Note on Interpretation</h4>
          <p>
            Functional labels like “weapon” or “hunting spear” risk flattening a complex life. Points live in ceremonies,
            bridewealth, oaths, and teaching kits. Without a secure excavated context and community testimony, this label
            keeps multiple possibilities open rather than declaring a single past.

  <!-- ============ Hidden modal content blocks (6 required items) ============ -->

  <!-- 1) Obsidian Spearhead -->
  <div class="modal-item" id="modal-text-obsidian" hidden>
    <h2 id="modal-title">Obsidian Spearhead — Collection Note</h2>
    <p><strong>Material:</strong> Volcanic glass (obsidian). <strong>Function:</strong> Spear point / hunting and defense. <strong>Location Found:</strong> Dune-margin campsite, inland Sahel.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Interpretation:</strong> Obsidian is sharper than steel but brittle; its maker chose speed and precision
      over durability. Long, parallel pressure flake scars run from base to tip, showing controlled manufacture and a
      preference for a slim profile that flies true. Polish at the base indicates hafting with fiber wrap and resin.
      Impact step-fractures at the tip hint at contact with bone or dense hide. Obsidian sources are absent locally,
      signaling trade or mobility; the point is thus also a map in miniature. In performance, such tips were part of a
      modular kit: foreshaft, main shaft, and counterweight swapped as conditions changed. The object teaches a practical
      ethic still relevant today—repair, reuse, and travel light without wasting edge.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- 2) Basaltic Glyphstone -->
  <div class="modal-item" id="modal-text-glyphstone" hidden>
    <h2 id="modal-title">Basaltic Glyphstone — Collection Note</h2>
    <p><strong>Material:</strong> Basalt boulder, iron-rich patina. <strong>Function:</strong> Boundary/oath marker. <strong>Location Found:</strong> River terrace near an abandoned causeway.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Interpretation:</strong> The shallow, crossing incisions are not letters so much as witnesses. Each scored
      line may pair a name with a promise—an oath renewed by touch. The working face tilts to shed rain; microscopic
      abrasion suggests pigment was sometimes rubbed into grooves so they could be counted at dawn. Basalt is non-local:
      dragging this heavy stone here anchored law to deep time rather than to a single ruler. Read as a net, the cuts
      catch on one another; obligations hold fast even as generations pass. It is both document and landscape, a page
      that could not blow away.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- 3) Coprolite Sample -->
  <div class="modal-item" id="modal-text-coprolite" hidden>
    <h2 id="modal-title">Coprolite Sample — Collection Note</h2>
    <p><strong>Material:</strong> Fossilized dung (human, likely). <strong>Function:</strong> Dietary and environmental record. <strong>Location Found:</strong> Shelter floor lens, silty layer above hearth.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Interpretation:</strong> Coprolites are time capsules. Under the microscope they unravel into seed coats,
      bone splinters, phytoliths, and even parasite eggs—evidence for meals, seasons, health, and risk. This piece holds
      milled grass starch, fish scale micro-plates, and charcoal flecks, pointing to a riverside diet during a cooler,
      dustier interval. The presence of medicinal seed fragments hints at plant knowledge shared across families. Though
      humble, the sample balances grand stories of kings with the intimate truth of digestion: survival is daily, local,
      and inventive.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- 4) Bronze Kohl Container -->
  <div class="modal-item" id="modal-text-kohl" hidden>
    <h2 id="modal-title">Bronze Kohl Container — Collection Note</h2>
    <p><strong>Material:</strong> Cast bronze with traces of galena. <strong>Function:</strong> Cosmetic / eye-kohl storage. <strong>Location Found:</strong> House courtyard refuse pit.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Interpretation:</strong> Kohl is both beauty and medicine; lining the eyelids cuts glare and may slow
      infection. This small container’s lip is darkened from the repeated dip and twist of an applicator stick. Its
      heft fits the palm, pocketable yet proudly made with a tiny foot that keeps the mouth clean off dusty floors.
      The bronze’s warm patina is not neglect but devotion: years of touch and oil turned metal into memory. Objects
      like this circulate between genders, ages, and roles—bridging care, adornment, and protection in a single gesture.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- 5) Cranial Vault Fragment -->
  <div class="modal-item" id="modal-text-cranial" hidden>
    <h2 id="modal-title">Cranial Vault Fragment — Collection Note</h2>
    <p><strong>Material:</strong> Human bone (parietal/occipital region). <strong>Function:</strong> Osteological evidence. <strong>Location Found:</strong> Disturbed burial soil, edge of flood scarp.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Interpretation:</strong> The inner surface preserves vascular impressions; the outer bears slight
      weathering but no peri-mortem cut marks. Thickness suggests an adult. A healed linear groove implies an old
      injury survived, while faint cribra orbitalia elsewhere in the assemblage hints at periodic iron stress.
      Ethical handling is paramount: this fragment represents a person whose descendants may yet speak for them.
      As data it informs population movement and health; as a life, it asks for care, consultation, and limits on
      what museums claim to know.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- 6) Faience Scarab Amulet -->
  <div class="modal-item" id="modal-text-scarab" hidden>
    <h2 id="modal-title">Faience Scarab Amulet — Collection Note</h2>
    <p><strong>Material:</strong> Copper-colored silica glaze (faience). <strong>Function:</strong> Protective amulet / identity marker. <strong>Location Found:</strong> Market quarter fill, near a bead workshop.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Interpretation:</strong> The beetle that rolls the sun reborn each dawn becomes an amulet that rolls luck
      toward its wearer. This scarab’s drill hole is polished from a cord; its underside bears a simple cross-hatched
      motif rather than formal hieroglyphs—local taste tuned to long-distance style. Faience’s blue-green is a promise
      of water and life in a dry land, achieved by clever chemistry with sand, copper, and fire. As ornament and
      passport, the piece moved between trade languages, declaring both belonging and aspiration.
